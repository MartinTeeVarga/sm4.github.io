## Bio

I am Czech, but I lived significant part of my life in Malaysia and Japan before I moved to Australia, where I code now. I think I was always meant to be a programmer. I was creating simple BASIC and assembler programs on a Z80 based computer since I was about 9. After a short episodes of Pascal, Delphi, C/C++, I switched to Java and stayed faithful until recently, where I start to flirt with many other languages.
 
## Professional Interests

My main interests are Java and Web Development, but I did a lot of back-end programming and touched most of the major Java frameworks. I am currently knee-deep in AWS.
 
## Hobbies

I used to make games for Android and I wrote a book about one of the Android 2D engines, [Learning AndEngine](http://android.kul.is/2014/07/learning-andengine-step-by-step.html). Unfortunately this framework was pretty much killed by inactivity. I played with JavaScript game frameworks, too.

I speak intermediate Japanese and trying to get better. I am not a big Manga or Anime fan, but I like Japan and challenges. I also maintain a page with Japanese reading materials for beginners, [Yomimaru](http://www.yomimaru.com/).
